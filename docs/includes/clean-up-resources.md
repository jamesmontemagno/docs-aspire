## Clean up resources

Run the following Azure CLI command to delete the resource group when you no longer need the Azure resources you created. Deleting the resource group also deletes the resources contained inside of it.

```azurecli
az group delete --name <your-resource-group-name>
```

For more information, see [Clean up resources in Azure](/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az-group-delete).
